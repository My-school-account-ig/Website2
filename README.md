If you want to add something to this website (create your own website) first make a fork and then make/edit the file and then you can create a pull request for me to (possibly) accept it in school (or possibly at home)

This will NOT be finacially supported and will only be something that I can do when I'm bored and I don't know what to do so I won't be getting (or I won't be expecting to get) any money from this

Thanks :3
